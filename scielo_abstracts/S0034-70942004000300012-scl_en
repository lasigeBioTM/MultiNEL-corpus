BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Gilbert's syndrome is a chronic benign disease leading to recurrent jaundice and major unconjugated bilirubin increase that may be toxic after the use of routine medication. This report aimed at describing the anesthetic approach in Gilbert's syndrome patient submitted to videolaparoscopic surgery. CASE REPORT: Female patient, 22 years old with Gilbert's syndrome, submitted to videolaparoscopic surgery under general anesthesia with propofol, alfentanil, succinylcholine, atracurium and isoflurane. There were no evidences of toxicity during anesthesia. Postoperative recovery was satisfactory and patient was discharged three days later. CONCLUSIONS: Gilbert's syndrome patients may be safely submitted to general anesthesia without toxicity, provided factors leading to glucuronosyltransferase activity decrease are avoided.
